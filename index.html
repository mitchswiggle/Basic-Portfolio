					<img src="assets/images/19936385.jpg">Hi, my name is Mitchel Snder. I have a lot of interest ranging from Physics, Gaming, Hiking, Playing with my kitten, and spending time with friends and family. I pride the fact that I suck at some of the competitive games I play. Either way I enjoy the games and have fun even though I play to win. My mom seems to know everyone on the internet and if everyones wishes come true, my family and I should have anywhere from 20-500 cases of cancer. <br><br> I love the idea of making websites and the ability to let my creativity come to life on a page.
